**Payments Policy**

**1. Accepted Payment Methods**
We offer a variety of secure payment methods to make your shopping experience as convenient as possible. We accept major credit and debit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. In addition, we offer payment options through PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other popular digital wallets. All payments must be made in the currency specified at checkout.

**2. Payment Security**
Your security is our top priority. All transactions on our website are processed using secure encryption technology to protect your personal and payment information. We do not store your credit card information on our servers. For additional security, some transactions may require verification or authorization from your payment provider. In such cases, we will contact you promptly to resolve any issues.

**3. Payment Authorization**
When you place an order, your payment method will be authorized, and funds will be reserved for the purchase. However, the payment will not be completed (captured) until your order is processed and ready for shipment. If there are any issues with your payment method or authorization, we will notify you immediately to ensure that your order can be processed without delay.

**4. Payment Failures and Declines**
In the event that a payment is declined or fails for any reason, please double-check the information entered and try again. If the problem persists, we recommend contacting your payment provider for assistance. Orders will not be processed until payment is successfully completed. If we are unable to resolve the issue, we may need to cancel the order, and you will be notified accordingly.

**5. Refunds and Payment Disputes**
If you are eligible for a refund, it will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. Please allow 5-7 business days for the refund to appear in your account, depending on your payment provider. In the event of a payment dispute, we encourage you to contact our customer service team first to resolve the issue. We are committed to working with you to find a fair and satisfactory solution.

This payments policy is designed to ensure a smooth and secure transaction process. If you have any questions or concerns about payment options, security, or any related issues, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team for assistance.
