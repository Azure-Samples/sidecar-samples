**Exchange and Returns Policy**

**1. Eligibility for Exchanges and Returns**
Our goal is to ensure your complete satisfaction with your purchase. If for any reason you are not satisfied, you may request an exchange or return within 30 days of receiving your order. To be eligible for an exchange or return, the item must be unused, in its original packaging, and in the same condition that you received it. Certain items, such as perishable goods, custom products, or items marked as final sale, are not eligible for returns or exchanges.

**2. Initiating an Exchange or Return**
To initiate an exchange or return, please contact our customer service team with your order number and the reason for the exchange or return. Once your request is approved, we will provide you with detailed instructions on how to return your item. Please do not send your item back without first receiving approval, as this may delay the processing of your return or exchange.

**3. Exchange Process**
If you wish to exchange an item for a different size, color, or model, we will do our best to accommodate your request, subject to availability. Once we receive and inspect the returned item, we will process the exchange and ship the new item to you. If the desired item is not available, we will issue a refund or store credit, depending on your preference.

**4. Refunds**
Refunds will be processed once the returned item has been received and inspected. If your return is approved, a credit will be applied to your original method of payment. Please allow 5-7 business days for the refund to appear on your account, depending on your payment provider. Original shipping charges are non-refundable unless the return is due to a mistake on our part, such as an incorrect or defective item.

**5. Return Shipping Costs**
Customers are responsible for covering the return shipping costs, except in cases where the item received was incorrect, damaged, or defective. We recommend using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance, as we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item. If you are returning an item for an exchange, we will cover the cost of shipping the new item to you.

This exchange and returns policy is designed to make the process as simple and straightforward as possible. If you have any questions or need further assistance, our customer service team is here to help.
